Transform README into professional MCP package documentation with comprehensive IDE/editor setup instructions. Added configuration guides for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Windsurf, Zed, and other MCP-compatible clients. Removed development-specific content and focused on user experience with clear installation steps, usage examples, and troubleshooting guides.
